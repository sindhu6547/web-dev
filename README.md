 <h3> Day 1 – To-Do List Application</h3>

<strong>**Project Overview:**  </strong>
The To-Do List application is a fundamental front-end project designed to manage daily tasks efficiently. It enables users to create, track, and remove tasks through an interactive interface. The project focuses on dynamically updating the user interface based on user actions, without reloading the page.

This application demonstrates the practical use of JavaScript for handling user events such as clicks, managing application state through DOM manipulation, and updating visual task status using CSS classes. It also highlights the importance of writing clean, reusable logic for dynamically created elements, making the project scalable and efficient.
